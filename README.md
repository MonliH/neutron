# Neutron
Neutron is a programming language inspired by C, Python, and Java. It is faster than normal Python 3 in most tests. Binary releases [here](https://github.com/the-neutron-foundation/neutron/releases). NOTE: the procomilled binaries don't work on Windows 10 (even the `.exe` ones). If on windows, you can try to [compile](https://neutron-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#installation) yourself.

# Documentation
There is a ReadTheDocs [here](https://neutron-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You may also look at the [grammar file](./grammar.txt) (very rough). There is also a [Gitter Chat here](https://gitter.im/The-Neutron-Foundation)

# Basic Usage
To use, run the filename as the first argument. For example, on Unix-like systems, you could do:

```
./neutron.bin path/to/neutron/file.ntn
```

The filename for neutron files is `.ntn`. FOr example, `important_file.ntn`.
